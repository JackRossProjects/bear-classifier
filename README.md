## Jack Tests Random ML Tools - FastAI

So here we go... Welcome to this very infromal series where I fail my way through various ML frameworks.<br>


1.) Got links for bear images

2.) Saved bear images in colab

3.) Trained

4.) Made accurate predictions of bears

5.) Struggled to figure out how in the living fuck to save a fastai model as a pkl file

6.) Consulted people way smarter than me

7.) Maybe I'm an idiot

8.) Finally broke down and... read the documentation for fastai... barf

9.) Realized that I had already saved a pkl file to /content/ in google drive

10.) I'm absolutely the next Andrew Ng

11.) Pkl file is too big to post to github so you'll just have to clone my notebook and hope to god I uploaded everything

12.) Uploaded pkl file to dropbox

13.) Could not figure out how to get a public link to my dropbox pkl file for a solid 20 mins

14.) Got that shit: https://www.dropbox.com/s/k9won4n7ga8yvqq/bears.pkl?raw=1

## Next tool! - Render

15.) Downloaded the Render classifier template

16.) Swapped my dropbox link and pkl file in server.py

17.) Tested web app locally

18.) It works. I rock.
